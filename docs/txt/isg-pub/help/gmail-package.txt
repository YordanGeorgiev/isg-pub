I have tested this feature only with mutt and gmail , but it should work with any other 
standard smtp server as well ... 

If you have installed and configured the mutt binary 
( cheat from the docs/txt/installation/04.configure-gmail-with-mutt.sh on how-to ... ) 

as well as the Emails in your conf file(s) ( see the Emails=some.recipient@domain.com in your conf file ) 

you can create a full package and send it via e-mail as follows:
bash sfw/bash/isg-pub/isg-pub.sh -a create-full-package -a gmail-package

you can create a deployment package and sending as follows:
bash sfw/bash/isg-pub/isg-pub.sh -a create-deployment-package -a gmail-package

you can send the latest created package by issuing the following shell call 
sfw/bash/isg-pub/isg-pub.sh -a gmail-package
